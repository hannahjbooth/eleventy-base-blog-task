<ul class="about-me">
<li class="study"><p>I am currently studying Web Development and Design on a Skills Bootcamp delivered by <a href="https://thecodersguild.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Coder's Guild</a>. The course also covers crucial skills for Software Developers.</p></li>
<li class="work">My goal is to become an apprentice Software Developer or Software Tester, and I am currently available for hire! </li>

<li class="background">I have a very mixed background: an early interest in computers in childhood, a French Scientific Baccalaureate, a Degree in Music (Leeds, 2015), as well as a professional background in Hospitality which has been very people, process and knowledge oriented.</li>
<li class="language"> I am also natively bilingual in French and English.</li>

<li class="traits">I love being creative, but I'm also strong with pattern recognition, languages and logic - hence the music/sciences overlap, and my love of programming! </li>

<li class="hobbies">My personal interests are centered around music, coding, growing plants, being outdoors, playing video games, cooking and always learning.</li>
