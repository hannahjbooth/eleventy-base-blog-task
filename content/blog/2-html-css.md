I joined my Skills Bootcamp in Web Development with a basic understanding of HTML & CSS. Whilst I was looking to build new skills, particularly in the areas of functional programming and working practices such as source control, I was very keen to establish strong habits with my basic coding. It was really helpful to cement my knowledge of HTML & CSS in the first instance.
