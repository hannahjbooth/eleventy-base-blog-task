Intro paragraph

## Key Learnings

- understanding frameworks 
- becoming familiar with working with documentation
- using responsivity features, the grid system and breakpoints
- applying flexbox principles
- troubleshooting with the dev tools
- inserting and customising components
- customising the CSS
- customising the JS?
- semantic HTML layout, limitations of Bootstrap?

## Creating a website using Bootstrap

- Create a semantic HTML layout to advertise a topic close to your heart, or a local business.
- Look around at designs for similar topics/businesses
- Create a similar site using Bootstrap components
- Feel free to add custom CSS on top - but the main components must be built using Bootstrap. 
- The footer will contain a copyright symbol and this year.

For my take-away task, I have created a placeholder website for an allotment site, which I have arranged to provide to the allotments I have a plot on, along with some IT assistance.

So far, I have integrated all the key aspects of my learnings on the topic of frameworks. 

I am continuing to work on the styling and the content of the page.
