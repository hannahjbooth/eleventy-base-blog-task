In the early stages of my Skills Bootcamp, we learnt about using frameworks for front-end development. We then put this into practice by learning to use the CSS framework Bootstrap on our own project.

<h2>Building a website using Bootstrap</h2>

For this task, we were free to customise the CSS, but the main components had to be built using Bootstrap. I have created a placeholder website for an allotment site, which I have arranged to provide to the allotments I have a plot on, along with a little IT assistance.

<h3>Key Learnings</h3>
<br>
<h4><b>Responsivity</b></h4> Bootstrap is a mobile first framework, so it was important to utilise its <b>breakpoint</b> system to include mobile users. My website has two main designs, one for phone screens, and one for larger screens.

<h4><b>The grid system</b></h4> I enjoyed the creativity allowed by the grid system for laying out content! I have placed my News and Events columns alongside my main content, and these sections are set to display one after the other on phone screens.

<h4><b>Documentation</b></h4>
<p>I drew from this both for adding and customising components on my page. I added a navigation bar, an FAQ section, a photo gallery in the form of a carousel, a contact form, and two listed sections for News and Events.</p>

<h4><b>Styling</b></h4> <p>I found it really useful to be able to apply styling straight to the classes of my elements - the documentation specifies ways of applying <b>flexbox</b>, margins, color, and so on - I used these to customise the Bootstrap components I've added.</p>
<h4><b>Going Forward</b></h4>

<p>So far, I have integrated to my page all the key aspects of my learnings on the topic of frameworks.</p>

<p>I am continuing to work on the styling and the content of the page.</p> 
<p>I'm conscious that Bootstrap can present certain limitations around semantic HTML - this is something I'm mindful of as I review my work.</p>
