In the early stages of my Skills Bootcamp, we learnt about using frameworks for front-end development. We then put this into practice by learning to use the CSS framework Bootstrap. In this blog post I will present my key learnings through the lens of my own project.

<h2>Building a website using Bootstrap</h2>

As part of this lesson, we were set the task of building a website for a local organisation. We were free to customise the CSS, but the main components had to be built using Bootstrap. I have created a placeholder website for an allotment site, which I have arranged to provide to the allotments I have a plot on, along with a little IT assistance.

<h3>Key Learnings</h3>

<h4><b>Responsivity:</b></h4> Bootstrap is a mobile first framework, so it was important to utilise its <b>breakpoint</b> system to include mobile users. My website has two main designs, one for phone screens, and one for larger screens.

<h4><b>The grid system:</b></h4> I enjoyed the creativity allowed by the grid system for laying out content! I have placed my News and Events columns alongside my main content, and these sections are set to display one after the other on phone screens.
ILLUSTRATION

<h4><b>Documentation:</b></h4> I drew from the documentation for both adding components to my page, and for customising the styling of my page.
<h5>Components:</h5> I added a navigation bar, an FAQ section, a photo gallery in the form of a carousel, a contact form, and two listed sections for News and Events.
<h5>Styling:</h5> I found it really useful to be able to apply styling straight to the classes of my elements - the documentation specifies ways of applying flexbox, margins, color, and so on - I used these to customise the Bootstrap components I've added.

- working with documentation:
- understanding frameworks 
- CDN vs 
- becoming familiar with working with documentation
- applying flexbox principles
- troubleshooting with the dev tools
- inserting and customising components
- customising the CSS
- customising the JS?
- semantic HTML layout, limitations of Bootstrap?


- Create a semantic HTML layout to advertise a topic close to your heart, or a local business.
- Look around at designs for similar topics/businesses
- Create a similar site using Bootstrap components
- Feel free to add custom CSS on top - but the main components must be built using Bootstrap. 
- The footer will contain a copyright symbol and this year.




So far, I have integrated all the key aspects of my learnings on the topic of frameworks. 

I am continuing to work on the styling and the content of the page.
