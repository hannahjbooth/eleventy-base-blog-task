In our first teaching session on JavaScript, we were introduced to variables and other basic programming concepts, such as using the console, data types, arithemtic operators, strings, concatenation and template literals. We were then assigned the following take-away task to complete and upload to our Eleventy blogs.

## Instructions

We’ll make a program to calculate a tip
01. Create variables for the pre-tip total and the tip percentage
02. Calculate the new total
03. Output a sentence to the
page - something like: “Your total bill, with tip, is £35.45”
Extension: round the figure to 2 DP and display the tip amount.

## My code

```diff-js
 // this is a command
 function myCommand() {
+  let counter = 0;
-  let counter = 1;
   counter++;
 }

 // Test with a line break above this line.
 console.log('Test');
```

## The result in the console
