In our initial class on working with Git, we learnt the core theoretical concepts around source control. This was followed by a very useful learning exercise on app Git-It, which helped cement what I now practice every day through my command line on VS Code and on GitHub.

<h2>Key take-aways:</h2>
<ul>
	<li class="git"><p>Git is a <b>version control system</b> which holds the history of every change saved to a project</p></li>
	<li class="git"><p>Many versions of a project may exist, on individual <b>branches</b>, for different working purposes - these are later <b>merged</b> back into a main branch (of which several types can also exist)</p></li>
	<li class="git"><p>A team of developers can <b>push</b> to and <b>pull</b> from a <b>remote repository</b>, in order to work on a <b>local repository</b> on their own computers</p></li>
	<li class="git"><p><b>Committing</b> changes often and with a precise and coherent <b>message</b> is best practice</p></li>
</ul>
