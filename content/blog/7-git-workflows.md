In our initial class on working with Git, we learnt the core theoretical concepts around source control. This was followed by a very useful learning exercise on app Git-It, which helped cement what I now practice every day through my command line on VS Code and on GitHub.

Key take-aways:

- Git is a version control system which holds the history of every change saved to a project
- Many versions of a project may exist, different on branches, for the purpose of working on specific tasks or versions - these are later merged back into a main branch
- A team of developers can push to and pull from a remote repository, in order to work on a local repository on their own computers
- Committing changes often and with a precise and coherent message is best practice

## Code

### Styled (with Syntax)

Bring to the table win-win survival strategies to ensure proactive domination. At the end of the day, going forward, a new normal that has evolved from generation X is on the runway heading towards a streamlined cloud solution. User generated content in real-time will have multiple touchpoints for offshoring.

```js
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
	let counter = 0;
	counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log('Test');
```
