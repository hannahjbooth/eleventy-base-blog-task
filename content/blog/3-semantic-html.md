<p>I really enjoyed the topic of semantic HTML. I love a logical, well-structured set of rules, and I really appreciate that well practiced semantic HTML has a direct positive impact anyone or anything using the page. Accessibility is a topic very close to my heart, so I enjoyed being able to integrate it to my coding. Also, I think it satisfies both my perfectionism and my instinct for pattern recognition. I almost feel like I'm going for a high score on a video game! Very satisfying.

<h2>Key take-aways on semantic HTML:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><p><b>Accessibility:</b> helps relevant software/hardware present the data in the page</p></li>
    <li><p><b>SEO:</b> effectively tells search engines about the page</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Maintenance:</b> clear code is easier to update, and importantly for other developers to work with</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Lighthouse audit:</b> its scores and measurements provide excellent guidelines</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA):</b> while "No ARIA is better than bad ARIA", its set of attributes, roles and properties (defined by W3C) can supplement existing HTML semantic very effectively.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Next steps:</h2>

During my studies, I've benefitted from reading the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">W3C Web Accessibility Initiative</a> website. My next goal is the complete their <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/courses/foundations-course/" target="_blank">Digital Accessibility Foundations online course</a>.
