<h1>About This Blog</h1>
<p>I built this blog as a task for one of my lessons on my course, which was about Static Site Generators. We used Eleventy. I also added Bootstrap to my blog, applying what I've learnt about frameworks.</p>
<p>I've used this blog to document and exemplify all my learnings throughout the course. You will find them tagged by theme.</p>
